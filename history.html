                <p>Once connected to the Scottish rail network, this line was lost to mid-20th-century railway cuts. Banff Bridge station closed in 1951, and Banff Harbour station in 1964. Today, the nearest open stations are in Huntly and Keith, about 20 miles away.</p>

            <h2>DUFF HOUSE</h2>
            <p> Duff House, designed by William Adam, was built in 1735 as the residence of William Duff, Lord Braco. Duff house went under further renovations gaining wings which were later bombed in WWII and never reconstructed.
                <p>Over the years, it served as a hotel (1911–13, 1923–28) and a sanatorium (1913–23), losing much of its original grandeur.</p>
                <p>During WWII, it was used as an internment and POW camp, and later as the headquarters for Allied regiments. A 1940 Luftwaffe bombing killed six German prisoners and two guards. In 1942, it became the Norwegian Brigade’s headquarters and later housed Polish soldiers awaiting resettlement.</p>
                <p>Falling into disrepair by the 1950s, the house underwent extensive restoration and reopened in 1995 as a country house gallery in partnership with the National Galleries of Scotland and Aberdeenshire Council.

            <h2>ARCHITECT & TRADE</h2>
            <p>Banff, a Royal Burgh since 1324, was a major Hanseatic trading town from the 12th century. By the 15th century, it was a key salmon exporter alongside Aberdeen and Montrose. The town’s first castle, built by 1163, defended against Viking invasions. Banff lacked a proper harbor until 1775, when shifting sandbanks blocked the River Deveron’s mouth. </p>
            <p>It has many historic buildings, including the highest number of Georgian listed buildings in Scotland outside Edinburgh. Significant buildings include the Town House (1797) and the Steeple (1764), designed by John Adam.</p>
            <p>Macduff’s first harbour was built in the 1770s and expanded in 1878. Throughout the 20th century, it was deepened to support the growing fishing industry. As boats increased in size, much of the fleet moved from Banff Harbour to Macduff which was less silty. Making Macduff known for its shipbuilding and repair industries.

                Today, Banff Harbour thrives as a marina for leisure boats, while Macduff Harbour remains a hub for fishing vessels of all sizes and maintains a busy repair facility.</p>

            <h2>TOWN WARS</h2>
            <p> James Macpherson, became known as a Robin Hood-like character. He and his followers were stole from the rich to give to the poor. Captured and sentenced to death, Macpherson played his Rant at the foot of the gallows before breaking his fiddle in two. Although he had been pardoned, Banff’s men set the town clock ahead, ensuring he was hanged before the message could reach him. This fueled the long-standing rivalry between Banff and Macduff, which lasted for centuries. The story of Macpherson’s Rant, heard by Robert Burns during his visit to Banff, was later published by the poet, further cementing Macpherson’s place in local legend. </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>FAMOUS VISITORS</h2>
            <p>The poet George Lord Byron, spent childhood summers in Banff, and was inspired by the town and it's people.
                Macduff was the home of Walford Bodie, a famous hypnotist and magician who influenced Charlie Chaplin and Houdini. Bodie funded public baths and supported the creation of Tarlair Golf Club, with the Bodie fountain and churchyard memorials commemorating his legacy.
                Thomas Edward, a Banff naturalist, gained recognition for his keen observations of nature.
                Samuel Johnson (writer) and James Boswell (writer/lawyer), stayed at the Black Bull Inn in 1773, and John Wesley brought his preaching of Methodism to the town.</p>
