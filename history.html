            <h2>DUFF HOUSE</h2>
            <p>made in the 1400s originally built with 2 wings that were bombed in WWII and never replaced. Duff House, designed by William Adam, was built in 1735 as the residence of William Duff, Lord Braco. Over the years, it served as a hotel (1911–13, 1923–28) and a sanatorium (1913–23), losing much of its original grandeur.

                During WWII, it was used as an internment and POW camp, and later as the headquarters for Allied regiments. A 1940 Luftwaffe bombing killed six German prisoners and two guards. In 1942, it became the Norwegian Brigade’s headquarters and later housed Polish soldiers awaiting resettlement.
                
                Falling into disrepair by the 1950s, the house underwent extensive restoration and reopened in 1995 as a country house gallery in partnership with the National Galleries of Scotland and Aberdeenshire Council.

            <h2>ARCHITECT & TRADE</h2>
            <p>Banff, a Royal Burgh since 1324, was a major Hanseatic trading town from the 12th century. By the 15th century, it was a key salmon exporter alongside Aberdeen and Montrose. The town’s first castle, built by 1163, defended against Viking invasions.

                Banff lacked a proper harbor until 1775, when shifting sandbanks blocked the River Deveron’s mouth. Significant buildings include the Town House (1797) and the Steeple (1764), designed by John Adam.</p>

            <h2>TOWN WARS</h2>
            <p> Banff’s rivalry with Macduff dates back to the hanging of MacPherson, a Robin Hood-like figure. Captured and sentenced to death, he was pardoned, but Banff men set the town clock ahead to hang him before the reprieve arrived. This animosity persisted for centuries </p>
